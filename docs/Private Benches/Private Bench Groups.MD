<p> With private bench groups you can unlock the pull power of Frappe Cloud. To understand what are private bench groups, first you have to understand what are <a href="https://docs.frappe.io/cloud/what-are-benches-and-bench-groups">Benches and Bench Groups</a></p>

<div markdown="1"><h2>Public Bench Groups</h2>
<p>Any site you create using the <code>+ New</code> button from Frappe Cloud dashboard home page, is created under a bench group that is maintained by us.<img class="screenshot" src="/files/m2B2oK6.png" alt="" contenteditable="false" draggable="true"><img class="ProseMirror-separator" alt=""><br class="ProseMirror-trailingBreak"></p><p>We call these bench groups public because any user's site can live in such bench groups. Users have <strong>no</strong> control over the bench group, i.e. you cannot add custom apps, update the existing apps, etc. You can see your sites which are on a public bench group under the <strong>Sites</strong> grouping inside dashboard.</p>

<blockquote><p>But I see updates on my site? Because we update public bench groups on a regular basis (mostly based on new Frappe Framework / ERPNext releases).</p></blockquote>



<h2>Private Bench Groups</h2>

<p>In contrast to public / managed bench groups, private bench groups <strong>are under your control</strong>. You get to choose what apps to add (yup, you can add your own custom apps too!), what apps to update, what region to deploy onto, SSH Access, Server scripts (v15+) etc are only available in a private bench group.</p><p><img src="/files/CRyWZQp.png" alt="" contenteditable="false" draggable="true"><img class="ProseMirror-separator" alt=""><br class="ProseMirror-trailingBreak"></p><p>Only your sites can live on your private bench group.</p><p>To learn how to create a new private bench group visit <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://frappecloud.com/docs/benches/create-new">this link.</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Private Bench Groups are available for sites on USD 25 and above plans.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Note: You are not billed for the bench groups you create, you are billed only when you create a site inside the bench group.</p></blockquote>
