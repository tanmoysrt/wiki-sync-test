> * [Python Versions](https://devguide.python.org/versions/#supported-versions)
> * [Bench Versions](https://github.com/frappe/bench/releases)
> * [Wkhtmltopdf Versions](https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf/releases)

When is my dependency version changed?
--------------------------------------

For your dependency version change to reflect, you have to [Update your Bench Group](https://frappecloud.com/docs/benches/updating_a_bench). After the update is complete, the new bench will be using the updated version.


> **ℹ️ Info**
> 
> Once you click on **Update** in the **Edit Dependency** dialog. The dependency version is updated in our system and is applied on subsequent deploys.
> 
> The current deploy remains unchanged.
