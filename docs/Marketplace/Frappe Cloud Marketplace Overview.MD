About

Frappe Cloud Marketplace is a platform to share your Frappe apps publicly with the community. It connects you to users using Frappe based sites. You can list free or paid apps for users to use it on their site.

Apps
----

Apps on the Marketplace are built on the [Frappe Framework](https://frappeframework.com). These apps can be extensions to existing apps like [ERPNext](https://frappecloud.com/marketplace/apps/erpnext) or can have fully-featured functionality like [Wiki](https://frappecloud.com/marketplace/apps/wiki).

To publish an app on the marketplace, you must be the owner and the app should be hosted on GitHub. After you submit your app for listing, it will be reviewed and published after an approval process.

If you are new to Frappe Framework and app development, you can go through the [Tutorial](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/tutorial).
