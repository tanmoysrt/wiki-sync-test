If you no longer want to use Frappe Cloud services and you want to delete your account, follow these steps:

1. Login to your dashboard
1. Click on Settings in the top bar
1. Under Team Actions section, click on the Delete button against Delete Account.
1. After you confirm, an account deletion request will be sent to the owner of the account. They need to confirm the request and after that account deletion will start.

Note:

- If you have any active sites, drop them first.
- If you have any unpaid invoices, or you have unbilled site usage, they will be billed first. Make sure you pay all of your past invoices, before requesting a deletion.
