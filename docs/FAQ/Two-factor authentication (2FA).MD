Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is a security measure that requires two different methods of verification to access an account.


> At the moment you can only use an authenticator app to enable 2FA

Authenticator App
-----------------

We use [TOTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-Time_Password) method, that generates a unique password that is valid for a limited time, for 2FA.

### Enable 2FA

1. Go to Settings and click on enable beside the enable 2FA option.
2. Download an authenticator app on your phone, such as [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) or [Aegis](https://github.com/beemdevelopment/Aegis) or use a browser extension like [1Password](https://support.1password.com/one-time-passwords/).
3. Scan the QR code using the app or extension.
4. Enter the code that's generated in the app to enable 2FA for your Frappe Cloud account.


> Make sure to backup your vault/keys through the app as losing it means you could potentially get locked out of your Frappe Cloud account

### Disable 2FA

1. Go to Settings and click on disable beside the disable 2FA option.
2. Open your authenticator app.
3. Enter the code that's generated in the app to disable 2FA for your Frappe Cloud account.
