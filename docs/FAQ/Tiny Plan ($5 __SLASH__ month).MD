### Why is it so cheap ?

This plan has a couple of constraints on resource usage, deployment location, and the ability to install only selected apps. Custom apps are also not permitted.

This plan provides

* 0.5 compute hour / day
* 250 MB of database storage
* 2.5 GB of disk storage

It has several limitations

* Currently, this plan is available only on Mumbai, KSA & Virginia region.
* Background jobs will be scheduled every 10 minutes, rather than every minute
* Incoming HTTP requests will be timed out in 30 seconds instead of 120 seconds.
* You can only specific apps on site. (scroll below to check the allowed apps list)
* We can add some other limitations on this plan as per requirement.

There are also some restrictions -

* You can't disable auto update of your site
* This plan is unavailable for private bench groups
* You can't downgrade to this plan from other plans

### Why is this plan available only in specific regions ?

Out of all the accessible regions, the Mumbai, KSA & Virginia Regions have servers at affordable rates to provide this 5$ plan.

### Why are there restrictions on the installation of apps ?

Tiny Plan allows only a limited number of apps to be installed. To ensure low-cost deployment, all apps must be optimized so that they do not cause issues for other sites, as the site will be placed on a shared server.

### Why can't I downgrade to this plan ?

Because of the limitations imposed, moving to this plan is not as easy as others, therefore, it is best to take a backup and restore it on a new 5$ plan site if you desire to do so.

### Why can't I upgrade to this plan ?

Same reason as above. Please do a backup/restore.

### **Allowed Apps**

Currently, these apps are allowed to install in $5 plan.
