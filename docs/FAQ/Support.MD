### I have a problem setting up ERPNext, can you help?

Frappe Cloud team does not deal with ERPNext issues. You can get help from our forum: [discuss.erpnext.com](https://discuss.erpnext.com) or buy professional support from [erpnext.com](https://erpnext.com).

### How can I buy ERPNext Support?

We don't provide support for any issues that are not related to hosting on Frappe Cloud. If you want support for your ERPNext site, you can buy it separately from erpnext.com.
