## Site Suspension for Exceeding Plan Usage

Effective from **16th June, 2025**


If your site exceeds the limits of your plan (either disk space or database usage), you will receive a notification. We will continue to monitor your site's usage for the next **7 days**, sending you daily alerts.

- If your usage returns to within plan limits during this period, the alerts will stop.
- If the usage remains above the limit and no plan upgrade is made, the site will be **automatically suspended** after 7 days.

To avoid suspension, you can either:

- Reduce your site’s storage to fit within your current plan, or
- Upgrade to a higher plan.

In either case, your site will be reactivated once it complies with the plan limits.
