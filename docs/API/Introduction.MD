The Frappe Cloud API allows you to manage your sites and bench groups using HTTP requests.

Most of the Frappe Cloud functionality available in the Frappe Cloud Dashboard is available through the API.

Since the beginning, we have only added new endpoints and new parameters to existing endpoints without modifying or removing existing endpoints.


> However, we can't provide any guarantees about the stability of this API. We will publish upcoming changes in this documentation.
