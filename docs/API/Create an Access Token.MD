You can create an API key and API secret from Frappe Cloud Dashboard, which together form an access token.

- API Key: Unique identifier for each user. Cannot be changed once generated.
- API Secret: Secret token to authenticate the request. Shown only once.

Key and secret pairs can be created from 
> [Dashboard](https://frappecloud.com/dashboard) > Settings > [Profile & Team](https://frappecloud.com/dashboard/account/profile) > API Access > Create New API Key

Copy the API secret, you will not be able to see it again. You could regenerate the API secret whenever required. Only the most recently created secret could be used for authentication.

> Note: API secret functions like a password. Keep it secret.
