# Site Plans

**Site Plans** in Frappe Cloud define the resources, capabilities, and limits available to your hosted site. They help ensure the right balance of performance, cost, and scalability as your usage grows. Each plan offers a fixed quota of compute power, storage, users, background jobs, and backup retention, allowing you to choose a tier that matches your workload. Whether you are running a lightweight development site or a full production ERP for hundreds of users, plans ensure predictable performance and easy scaling.

## Why Site Plans Matter

A Site on Frappe Cloud consumes CPU, memory, storage, and network resources. As your business grows—more users, more transactions, more custom scripts—you need more computing power. Site Plans provide clarity and structure so you can deploy confidently. Instead of manually sizing infrastructure, you select a plan, and Frappe Cloud allocates and manages resources behind the scenes.

Plans also define support level, automation features, security enhancements, and scheduled backups. A development site might only need basic resources, but a production ERP requires high uptime, dedicated workers, frequent backups, and scaling support. Plans ensure you pay only for what you actually need.

Just a tiny update.

## What a Plan Usually Includes

| CPU & RAM | Determines speed of processing and concurrency |
| Storage | Defines space for database + uploaded files |
| Users | Number of active system users allowed |
| Workers | Background job capacity and queue throughput |
| Backup Retention | How long backups are stored and available |
| App Limits | Number of apps you can install on the site |
| Security & Support | Priority response, monitoring, compliance tools |

## Choosing the Right Plan

Start small, upgrade when usage increases. If reports slow down, workers queue too long, or storage fills, a higher plan helps. Scaling is seamless—no downtime, no manual migration. For mission-critical ERP deployments, a high-tier plan ensures stability, security, and responsive performance.

In short, **Site Plans let you match infrastructure to business needs**, keeping your Frappe site fast, reliable, and future-ready.
