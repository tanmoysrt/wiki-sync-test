1. You need to first generate a database user for your site. Follow this [documentation](https://frappecloud.com/docs/database-users-and-permission-manager) to create a read-only user.

  


Typically, it takes a few seconds to configure the database user. Once it's complete, click on **View Credential**

2. Open your Metabase dashboard and click on **Add database**.
3. Choose **MySQL** as Database Type and fill all the database user related information.  
  


**Note :** Ensure that `Use a secure Connection (SSL)` is checked.

  


For **Server SSL certificate Chain**, check the **Step 1** and download the certificate first. Next, open your operating system's default text editor and copy- paste to metabase.
