You may notice that the sites you create within your dedicated server are all assigned an **Unlimited** plan by default or **Unlimited - Supported,** depending on whether you choose to avail support on it. At some point you may add other smaller (based on usage) sites to the same server as it's free (technically).  
  
In such cases, you can set **Unlimited - Low** plan on the site, and you should if it's on a different bench and does not need as many resources as your main site. This way, fewer resources are allocated to this site and won't cause a noisy neighbor problem for your main site for which you have provisioned the dedicated server.
