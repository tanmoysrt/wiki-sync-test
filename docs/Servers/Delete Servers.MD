Deleting a server will delete both the application and the database server immediately. Be careful when deleting servers since you can **NOT** recover a server after deleting it.

> Note: You must delete all sites and bench groups before deleting the server.

1. Go to the Server Dashboard>Actions>Dangerous Actions>Drop Server
